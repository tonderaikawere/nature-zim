# Vercel Deployment Guide for Nature Zimbabwe

## Current Issue: 404 NOT_FOUND

The 404 error on Vercel is likely due to Flask app configuration. Here are the solutions:

## Solution 1: Use the Updated Configuration

I've created the necessary files for Vercel deployment:

### Files Created:
1. **vercel.json** - Main Vercel configuration
2. **index.py** - Alternative entry point
3. **api/index.py** - API folder structure (Vercel preferred)
4. **.vercelignore** - Exclude unnecessary files

## Solution 2: Try Different Deployment Methods

### Method A: Main App Deployment
1. Use the current `vercel.json` file
2. Make sure `app.py` is the main file
3. Redeploy to Vercel

### Method B: API Folder Structure
1. Rename `vercel.json` to `vercel-backup.json`
2. Rename `vercel-alternative.json` to `vercel.json`
3. The app will use `api/index.py` as entry point
4. Redeploy to Vercel

## Solution 3: Debug Steps

### Step 1: Test Basic Functionality
Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/debug`
This should show Flask app information if it's running.

### Step 2: Check Vercel Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your deployment
3. Check the "Functions" tab for errors
4. Look at build logs for issues

### Step 3: Common Fixes

#### Fix 1: Update vercel.json
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "app.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/app.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Fix 2: Ensure Proper Flask Export
In `app.py`, make sure you have:
```python
# At the end of app.py
application = app  # This line is crucial for Vercel
```

#### Fix 3: Check Requirements
Make sure `requirements.txt` includes:
```
Flask==2.3.3
Werkzeug==2.3.7
```

## Solution 4: Alternative Deployment Platforms

If Vercel continues to have issues, consider:

### Render.com
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Choose "Web Service"
3. Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start Command: `python app.py`

### Railway.app
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Auto-detects Flask app
3. Deploys automatically

### Heroku
1. Create `Procfile`: `web: python app.py`
2. Push to Heroku Git

## Solution 5: Quick Test Deployment

### Test with Minimal App
1. Temporarily replace `vercel.json` with `vercel-alternative.json`
2. This uses the simple `api/index.py` file
3. If this works, gradually add features back

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] `vercel.json` exists and is properly formatted
- [ ] `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies
- [ ] `app.py` has `application = app` at the end
- [ ] No syntax errors in Python files
- [ ] Templates folder exists and has all HTML files
- [ ] Static folder exists and has CSS/JS files

## Next Steps

1. **Try Method B first** (API folder structure)
2. **Check Vercel logs** for specific error messages
3. **Test the /debug route** to see if Flask is running
4. **Contact me** if issues persist - I can help debug further

## Files to Commit and Push

Make sure these files are in your GitHub repository:
- `vercel.json`
- `index.py`
- `api/index.py`
- `.vercelignore`
- Updated `app.py` with `application = app`

## Expected URLs After Deployment

- Main site: `https://your-app.vercel.app/`
- Debug info: `https://your-app.vercel.app/debug`
- Games: `https://your-app.vercel.app/games`
- Animal sounds: `https://your-app.vercel.app/games/animal-sounds`

The deployment should work with these configurations. Let me know if you need help with any specific errors!
